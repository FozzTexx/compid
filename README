This is intended to be a program that will run on any computer that
runs BASIC which will be able to identify what model of computer it
is. I doubt it will really be possible since there are a lot of
differences in each BASIC, as well as some computers are extremely
limited in the amount of memory they have and I'm sure this program
will quickly get too big to fit.
